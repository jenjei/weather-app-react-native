## Further development

- Settings: Fahrenheit, Celsius
- Developing layout more professional (colors -> get rid of those "color codes", styling buttons etc)
- Current Weather: "show weather in your location" button would fetch weather data via gps if user allows (same way like forecast)
- Separate StyleSheets from components
- Make this app more Android friendly
- Error handling
- Implement some sort of testing
